    <title>Multi-Generator (MGEN)</title>

    <para>The Multi-Generator (MGEN) is open source software developed by the
    <ulink url="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval Research Laboratory</ulink>
    (NRL) PROTocol Engineering Advanced Networking (PROTEAN) Research Group.
    MGEN provides the ability to perform IP network performance tests and
    measurements using TCP and UDP/IP traffic .</para>

    <para>The toolset generates real-time traffic patterns so that the network
    can be loaded in a variety of ways. The generated traffic can also be
    received and logged for analysis. Script files are used to drive the
    generated loading patterns over the course of time. These script files can
    be used to emulate the traffic patterns of unicast and/or multicast UDP
    and TCP IP applications. The receive portion of this tool set can be
    scripted to dynamically join and leave IP multicast groups and listen for
    TCP traffic. MGEN log data can be used to calculate performance statistics
    on throughput, packet loss rates, communication delay, and more. MGEN
    currently runs on various Unix-based (including MacOS X) and Win32
    platforms.</para>

    <para>Mgen can also be used in network simulation environments like ns-2
    and opnet. For ns-2, an MGEN Agent is available that can operate within
    the simulation environment. Mgen commands may be passed to the ns-2 MGEN
    agent in ns-2 TCL scripts as with other ns-2 agents. [TODO: Words on
    opnet]</para>

    <para>The current version of MGEN is 5.x although previous versions (MGEN
    4.x and MGEN 3.x) are available. Note that version MGEN 3.x is not
    interoperable with the later versions. At present, only MGEN 3.x has
    graphical user interface support. </para>

  <section>
    <title>MGEN Version 5.0</title>

    <para>This is the latest version of the MGEN toolset. This version
    supports TCP messaging, IPv6 networking, and provides support for Win32
    platforms in addition to a broad base of Unix-based platforms. This
    version features a more modular code architecture than previous versions.
    Support for additional statistical traffic generation patterns (JITTER and
    CLONE), transport buffering, message count, and payload enhancements have
    been been added in addition to other features documented in the release
    notes. At this point in time, MGEN 5.x encompasses the feature set of MGEN
    4.x. Mgen 5.x can also be embedded in a <ulink

    <title>MGEN 5.x Installation</title>

    <para>In some cases, prebuilt binary distributions are available. However,
    the mgen application can be easily built on most Unix-based platforms and
    Win32 platforms. The <emphasis>MGEN</emphasis> source code is also
    available for checkout from a downloads directory at <ulink
    url="http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/mgen">http://downloads.pf.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects/mgen</ulink>.
    See the instructions there for further details. Note that the NRL <ulink
