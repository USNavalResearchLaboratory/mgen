# This file contains the IP routing tables built by various routing protocols in
# the network model.

# It is intended to be used as a mechanism whereby dynamic routing information
# is recorded and reused to avoid running IP routing protocols in multiple
# simulations of the same network. This feature should be used only when router
# connectivities in the network (and hence their routing tables) do not change
# during the course of the simulation.

# This file is produced each time a simulation is run with the simulation
# attribute "Routing Table Export/Import"  set to "Export". Multiple runs for
# the same network model will successively overwrite this file.

# The contents of this file can be imported into the network model by running a
# simulation with the simulation attribute "Routing Table Export/Import" to 
# "Import".

# In order for this to work correctly, there should be no change in the network
# whose simulation produced this file, and the network that is importing it
# contents. In other words, the "Export" scenario and the "Import" scenario
# should be the same.

# Warning: Modification of this file by the user can lead to unexpected simulation
# results.
