Version 5.01c
=============
    - Contains bug fixes for compilation under Visual Studio 6.0
    - Contains fix to retain src port when flow mod command is
      issued.
    - Other unenumerated bug fixes.

Version 5.01b
=============
    - Transport classes have been abstracted.  Socket, UDP, TCP, and SINK
      transport classes now subclass base transport class.
    - New SINK class is based on ProtoChannel.
    - New pattern options JITTER and CLONE.
    - Transport buffering has been added (QUEUE option).
    - Message COUNT support added.  (Concrete limit for messages sent
      per flow.)
    - Log file changes (new TCP messages and additional message content)
    - Thanks to Laurie Thompson for lots of good work on all of this stuff.
    - Changed long/unsigned long/etc types to INT32/UINT32/etc to support
      builds on 64-bit and other architectures.
    - Applied SO_BROADCAST socket option provided by Eric Auerswald.

Version 4.2b7
=============
    - Added support for TCP protocol.  
    - Mgen contains support to enable it to be embedded in a 
      rapr application.
      - Payload can be specified for a specific flow on the command
        line. 
      - Specifying a "0" src port will cause the OS to randomly
        assign one.  (NOT specifying a src port does the same)
      - Support for a mgen "controller" class added.
    - Compile option to random fill the payload buffer. 
    - Added new "localtime" command line option to enable logging
      in localtime versus gmtime.  gmtime is the default.
    - Mgen now a subclass of MgenSocketList
    - Various tweaks to keep purify happy.

Version 4.2b6
=============
    - Tweaks so gcc 4.x compiles will succeed
    - Includes ProtoSocket tweaks for NT4 support

Version 4.2b5
=============
    - Various tweaks and changes

Version 4.2b4
=============
    - Added several new options and updated documentation
    - Added "instance <instanceName>" for run-time control of MGEN
    - Added "hostAddr {on|off}" to include "host" source addr
    - Added "precise {on|off}" for optional precision timing of
      messages at expense of added CPU loading.
    - Added short message check to unpacking routine
      (prevents segmentation fault possible when checking corrupt UDP packets)
    - Performance tweaks and Protolib updates
    
Version 4.2b3
=============
    - Some protolib changes
    - Performance tweaks (read all available data from recv ready sockets)

Version 4.2b1
=============
    - Added "flush" option and made per-packet flushing of log
      file optional (non-default) behavior
    - MGEN ported to new "Protolib 2" ("Protokit") code base

Version 4.1b1
=============
    - Added "sink/source" options for streaming MGEN messages to
      other processes (e.g. ssh, norm, etc - tested on Unix only)
    - Changed packet format so that message "length" comes first
    - Added "checksum" option
    - Added "event" command-line command to insert script flow events
      from command-line
    - Added option to build ns-2 "Agent/Mgen" simulation agent.

Version 4.0x6
=============
    - Fixed problem when flows 0.0 pkt/sec were scripted.
    - Added script parameter checks
    - Added code to detect ambiguous script keyword abbreviations
    - Added default tos,ttl,txbuffer,rxbuffer, and interface.
      All of the above may be used as command-line and/or
      script arguments. Script arguments may be socket-specific
      or global. 

    
Version 4.0x5
=============
    - Fixed location of gps_status field to match documented (intended)
      MGEN message payload format.
      
    - Added "offset <sec>" command to skip into script by an offset
    
    - Added "save <saveFile>" command to save flow sequence and
      script offset time upon exit.
      
    - Added binary log file option and "convert" command to convert
      binary MGEN logs to default text format.
      
    - Added new "BURST" pattern.
    
    - Added IPv6 Flow Label support.
    
    - Added "MGEN Payload Manager (mpmgr)" support to allow limited
      user-defined payload to be added to MGEN 4.x messages.

Version 4.0x4
=============
    - Fixed bug with MGEN message size logging
    
Version 4.0x3
=============
    - Added logging of MGEN START/STOP events
    - Added support for START, INPUT, and OUTPUT global commands
    
Version 4.0x2
=============
    - Initial working MGENv4 build.
